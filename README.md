## Silmaripedia - What is it?
<br>
Silmaripedia is an encyclopedia for all who loves Tolkien's trilogy. I've collected all characters from the book and insert into this application. Also I have added images that represents specific character from the book. Application was written in C# programming language.

## What Silmaripedia contains?
<br>
Silmaripedia contains 49 characters from the book. Each character is assigned a unique photo and biography. Clicking on a character from the list opens a pop-up windows with photo. Pop-up windows can be blocked in settings. There's attached a manual in the program in HTML Help file format (.chm).

## Is Silmaripedia multilingual?
<br>
No. Silmaripedia is completely written in polish language. There's a chance for a multilingual version one day.
